I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.ivao.aero" target="_blank">IVAO </a> by pure chance in June 2019 and joined the network. After a while I started as controller at Nuremberg Airport, then moved on to my home airport in Munich. In June 2020, I became part of the <a href="https://de.ivao.aero" target="_blank">IVAO Germany</a> staff as a Membership Advisor. Since then, the Membership Department hasn't let me go.

To make my life as a pilot a bit easier, I've programmed some small tools for IVAO in my free time. I'd like to share them with other members on this page.
