You sometimes miss relevant traffic entering your sector? Occasionally focused on other tasks while controlling and not always watching the radar screen? Then the Aurora plugin **Traffic Watch** brings your attention back to where it matters.  
It monitors newly appearing aircraft and notifies you with **visual and sound alerts** – so you’ll never miss important traffic again.
